# Background Jobs

Frappe ships with a system for running jobs in the background. It is implemented by using the [schedule package](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and a simple long-running infinite [while loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop).

## Enqueue a Python Method

You can enqueue a Python method to run in the background by using the `frappe.enqueue` method:

```python
def long_running_job(param1, param2):
    # expensive tasks
    pass

# directly pass the function
frappe.enqueue(long_running_job, queue='short', param1='A', param2='B')

# or pass the full module path as string
frappe.enqueue('app.module.folder.long_running_job', queue='short', param1='A', param2='B')
```

### Arguments for `frappe.enqueue`

Here are all the possible arguments you can pass to the `enqueue` method:

```python
frappe.enqueue(
    method, # python function or a module path as string
    queue="default", # one of short, default, long
    timeout=None, # pass timeout manually
    is_async=True, # if this is True, method is run in worker
    now=False, # if this is True, method is run directly (not in a worker) 
    job_name=None, # specify a job name
    enqueue_after_commit=False, # enqueue the job after the database commit is done at the end of the request
    at_front=False, # put the job at the front of the queue
    track_job=False, # tracks some metadata in `Background Task` doctype
    **kwargs, # kwargs are passed to the method as arguments
)
```

## Enqueue a Document Method

You can also enqueue a Document method by using `frappe.enqueue_doc`:

```python
frappe.enqueue_doc(
    doctype,
    name,
    "do_something", # name of the controller method
    queue="long",
    timeout=4000,
    param="value"
)
```

## Queue

There are 3 default queues that are configured with the framework: `short`, `default`, and `long`. Each queue has a default timeout as follows:

- **short**: 300 seconds
- **default**: 300 seconds
- **long**: 1500 seconds

You can also pass a custom timeout to the `enqueue` method.

## Custom Queues

You can add custom queues by configuring them in [common_site_config.json](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/basics/site_config#common-site-config):

```json
{
    ...
    "workers": {
        "myqueue": {
            "timeout": 5000, # queue timeout
            "background_workers": 4 # number of workers for this queue
        }   
    }
}
```

## Workers

By default, Frappe sets up 3 worker types for consuming from each queue. The default configuration looks like this:

```bash
bench worker --queue short
bench worker --queue default
bench worker --queue long
```

In production, these 3 worker processes are replicated to the configured number of background workers to handle higher workloads.

### Multi-Queue Consumption

You can specify more than one queue for workers to consume from by specifying a comma-separated string of queue names:

```bash
bench worker --queue short,default
bench worker --queue long
```

### Burst Mode using `--burst`

```bash
bench worker --queue short --burst
```

This command will spawn a temporary worker that will start consuming the `short` queue and quit once the queue is empty.

## Scheduler Events

You can use Scheduler Events for running tasks periodically in the background using the `scheduler_events` hook.

### Example

In `app/hooks.py`:

```python
scheduler_events = {
    "hourly": [
        # will run hourly
        "app.scheduled_tasks.update_database_usage"
    ],
}
```

In `app/scheduled_tasks.py`:

```python
def update_database_usage():
    pass
```

After changing any scheduled events in `hooks.py`, you need to run `bench migrate` for changes to take effect.

### Available Events

- **hourly**, **daily**, **weekly**, and **monthly**: These events will trigger every hour, day, week, and month respectively.
- **hourly_long**, **daily_long**, **weekly_long**, **monthly_long**: Same as above but these jobs are run in the `long` worker suitable for long-running jobs.
- **all**: The `all` event is triggered every 4 minutes. This can be configured via the `scheduler_interval` key in `common_site_config.json`.
- **cron**: A valid cron string that can be parsed by [croniter](https://github.com/kiorky/croniter).

### Usage Examples

```python
scheduler_events = {
    "daily": [
        "app.scheduled_tasks.manage_recurring_invoices"
    ],
    "daily_long": [
        "app.scheduled_tasks.take_backups_daily"
    ],
    "cron": {
        "15 18 * * *": [
            "app.scheduled_tasks.delete_all_barcodes_for_users"
        ],
        "*/6 * * * *": [
            "app.scheduled_tasks.collect_error_snapshots"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Configurable Scheduler Events

For scenarios that require a user-configurable trigger interval, create a `Scheduler Event` record and create a `Scheduled Job Type` entry against that record. This doesn't require the `scheduler_event` hook.

### Example

```python
# Create `Scheduler Event` record
sch_eve = frappe.new_doc("Scheduler Event")
sch_eve.scheduled_against = "Process Payment Reconciliation"
sch_eve.save()

# Create `Scheduled Job Type`
job = frappe.new_doc("Scheduled Job Type")
job.frequency = "Cron"
job.scheduler_event = sch_eve.name
job.cron_format = "0/5 * * * *"     # runs every five minutes
job.save()
```

The `Scheduled Job Type`'s trigger interval can be modified later, which persists across bench migrations.

> **Note**: The jobs triggered by the scheduler are run by the `Administrator` user. This also means any docs you create via a scheduled job will be owned by the `Administrator` user unless specified otherwise.
