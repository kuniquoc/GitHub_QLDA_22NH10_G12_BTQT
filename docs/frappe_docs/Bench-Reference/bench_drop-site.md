# bench drop-site

## Usage
`bench drop-site [OPTIONS] SITE`

## Description
Drop an existing site. In this operation, the database is dropped and the respective site's folder is moved from `./sites` to `./archived_sites` (unless specified otherwise) on your Bench. A full site backup is taken prior to this.

## Options
- `--db-root-username`: Username for a DBMS user with drop database privileges. Defaults to `root`.
- `--db-root-password`: Password for the DBMS user.
- `--archived-sites-path`: Specify the path to move the site's folder in.

## Flags
- `--no-backup`: Skip backup prior to site drop.
- `--force`: Force drop-site even if an error is encountered.

## Examples
1. Skip the interactive prompt by passing the root password:
   ```
   bench drop-site {site} --db-root-password {db-root-pass}
   ```
